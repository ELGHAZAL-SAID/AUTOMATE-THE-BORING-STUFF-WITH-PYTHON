#the absolute path starts with the root folder (/) in linux and (c:/) in windows

# it is a concatenation of the absolute path and a relative path with will be C:/Users/Ai

# the os.getcwd() and os.chdir() are a os module functions, the first one for getting the current dir path and the second is for changing the current dir

# the '.' stands for the current folder and '..' for the previous folder

# for windows the dir name is 'C:\Users\eggs\' and the base name is spam.txt

# there is the read mode, the write mode and the append mode

# if a file is open in write mode its content will be overwritten by the new content and you can not read its content

# the read()function returns the contents of a plain test file as the single string wile the readlines() it return list of lines 

# it is the same as the dictionary data structure
