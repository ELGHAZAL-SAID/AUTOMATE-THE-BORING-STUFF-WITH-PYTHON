# shutil.copy used to copy one single file, while shutil.copytree used to copy an entire directory tree 

# we can use os function <os.rename()>

# the first one the removed file the recycling bin the second removed the the file or folder directly 

# the equivalent of open() method is zipfile.ZipFile() method from zipfile module
