# no it dose not, you need to install it first to use it later

# it's because of the module name pyInputPlus

# inputInt gets integers but inputFloat accepts just the float

# you can add a allowRegexes to make the accepted given value between 0 and 99 and use blockRegexex to block every thing except that

# we pass a list of Regexes 

# it returns an exception error wish is RetryLimitException

# it will return the default value with is 'hello'
